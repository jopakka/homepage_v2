            "I am a third year student majoring in mobile solutions in Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. My interest in coding started a few years ago, when my friend was studying game development, and we made a few games to game jams together. After a while I decided that I want to apply to study programming and in our first year I liked mobile development the most, so I chose that major.",
            "During my first year in Smart IoT-devices, we had C-programming and our project was to program an Arduino-bot to follow a line track, battle on a sumo arena and solve a simple maze. In Mobile health application we made an Android app with Java. Our project there was a food diary. On web techniques and digital media, we had HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our project there was a poker and blackjack site, where you could play against simple “AI”. In game development we made a game with Unity and C#. We made a third-person shooting game, where the player fights against mafia.",
            "In second year we had Object-Oriented Programming and Data communication where we made an Android app using Kotlin. There our project was a word quiz app, where the user guesses words from one language to another. Then we studied basic concepts of web technology, which includes responsive design with HTML and CSS, and back-end REST api with Node.js.",
            "During this third year we have studied sensors on Android, and made a project which shows the user interesting activities, places and events around Helsinki. Then we made a project for a real customer. Our group made the project for ClimbStation. They needed an application for their new device which has better UI than their old design and so that users could use their own mobile phones to operate the machine."
